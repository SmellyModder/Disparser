# About Disparsr
Disparser is a simple WIP command parser for JDA, the Java Discord API.
It allows for easy and performant usage of commands with multiple aliases and various arguments.
Disparser was originally made for some JDA bots I made so I could easily have a nice simple command framework, and I've now decided to have it here separately.
Disparser will stay relatively small and simple forever, offerring simple and efficient command parsing for JDA.
<br> *It is a WIP, so expect new features!* </br>

## Usage
Currently there is no Maven that disparser is hosted on, but that'll be fixed relatively soon.
<br> If you wish to try it out in the early stages it's in right now you can build it yourself by downloading the repository source and building it with the gradle using the `gradlew build` command. </br>
